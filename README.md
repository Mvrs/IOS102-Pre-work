## Introduce IOS APP

Hi CodePath, My name is Marlon Johnson and I"m a fourth year Senior graduating this Spring 2023 Semester. I'm exciting about taking this course because I want to improve my Mobile Engineering skills, and gain experience developing an app using a Native Language. Coming from a background with deep React Native experience, sometimes there are times you might need to know how to build Native Modules due to lack of Support (if using the Expo SDK) or Performance Reasons, so having new found knowledge from taking this course is an amazing opportunity to take my skillset to the next level. 

### App Description

This is my prework solution for the CodePath's IOS102 course. 


### App Walk-though

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.
